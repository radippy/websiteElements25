<p>A set of principles concerned with the nature and appreciation of beauty.
Beauty is one of the main subjects of aesthetics, together with art and taste. Many of its definitions include the idea that an object is beautiful if perceiving it is accompanied by aesthetic pleasure. Among the examples of beautiful objects are landscapes, sunsets, humans and works of art.

To be aesthetic is to be pleasurable to look at or perceived as beautiful by the viewer.

                <p>Discount Beds Belfast: This website is extremely out-dated and lacks a modern design. It does not include many modern features that are easily accessible. The set out of the page is lacking format, the font selection is poor and the color scheme could be re designed.  These features make the whole website look bad. This makes the whole company as a whole look worse just because of their website. </p>

                <p>Xmas Tree Farm UK:This website is extremely bland. When it is first opened it takes above averagely normal to open and when it did load it was not visually appealing. There was not a lot of colour and the main text was unclear. The layout was overall confusing. </p>

                <p>Worldâ€™s Worst Website and The Big Ugly Website:
                These are websites made purposely to show the effects of poor aesthetic designs. On these websites it shows what happens when you have too many moving objects and a bad choice of colour scheme. This website gives us a good example of what our websites should not look like. It clearly demonstrates what we should watch out for when making a website.
