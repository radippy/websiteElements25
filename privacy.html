                 <h2>Privacy:</h2>   
                 
<p>
The definition of online privacy is the level of privacy protection an individual has while connected to the Internet. It covers the amount of online security available for personal and financial data,communication and preferences.
</p><p>
Formal Definition of Privacy on a Website:
</p>
<p>Privacy on a website refers to the protection of personal information that is collected, used,
disclosed, and stored by a website or its third-party service providers. This personal
information includes any data that can identify an individual, such as name, address, email,
phone number, and financial information. Protecting privacy on a website involves
compliance with data protection laws and regulations, as well as the implementation of
technical and organizational measures to ensure that personal information is kept
confidential, secure, and used only for lawful purposes.

            <h2> Reasons for Ensuring Websites are Built with Privacy in Mind</h2>  
            <p> Many countries have laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of
personal information. Non-compliance with these laws can result in severe penalties,
including fines and reputational damage.</p>
            <p>Website visitors expect their personal information to be treated with respect and kept
confidential. Failure to protect personal information can lead to a loss of trust in the website
and its owners.</p>
            <p>Privacy breaches and data leaks can damage a company&#39;s reputation, leading to a loss of
customers, revenue, and market share.</p>
